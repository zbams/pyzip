# pyzip
simple python command line application for zipping and unzipping files and directories automatically

drag and drop files/directory to zip or unzip!

the way it works:
  if the file is a zip file already then unzip
  otherwise zip the file
  
Supports multiple files meaning 2 files will get you 2 zips 1 directory will get 1 zip
